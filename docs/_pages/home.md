### Short Bio
Wenlu Wang is an assistant professor in the Department of Computing Sciences at Texas A&M University Corpus Christi. She received her Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Auburn University in 2020 (supervised by [Wei-Shinn Ku](http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~weishinn/)). She received the B.E. degree in computer science at Beihang University, and the M.S. degree in computer science at New York University.

I am looking for graduate students, new collaborations, etc. Please get in touch if you're interested in joining the group or working together. 

### Research Interests
<b>Deep Learning and Machine Learning</b>.

<p style="color:red">I am open to interdisciplinary or any other types of collaborations, feel free to drop me an email!</p>

I also work on sequential modeling for high-impact applications including: [natural language interface](https://wenlu-w.github.io/project/2021/01/01/NLIDB.html), <b>[GeoSpatial AI](https://wenlu-w.github.io/project/2021/06/01/spatial.html)</b>, and computational biology & chemistry.
