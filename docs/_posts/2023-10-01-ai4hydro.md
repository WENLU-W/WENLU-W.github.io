### AI-powered Diagnosis Augmented by Self-sustaining Sensing System for Intelligent Wastewater Infrastructure Management

<a href=""> <img align="center" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/water.png" style="width: 800px; box-shadow: none;"></a><br>

**Project Goals**

The proposed work will revolutionize the urban wastewater system by transforming hydrological and hydraulic science and expert knowledge into customized deep models, augmented by self-sustaining sensing system for intelligent wastewater management.

**Research Challenges**

  We propose (1) training a wastewater hydraulic surrogate model using Graph Neural Network (GNN); (2) augmenting the surrogate model with a physical monitoring system deployed on the wastewater infrastructure with sensors; and (3) automatic anomalies detection, allowing timely corrective actions. 

**Current/Final Results (summary)**

   In progress.

**Broader Impacts**

  The proposed research will have a positive impact on public safety and health in coastal and other communities with degraded wastewater systems. As early access to advanced AI decision-making tools has the potential to exacerbate existing inequalities by giving more resources to those already with access to new technologies. The proposed research seeks to counteract this by putting AI research into practice and ensuring that AI benefits all residents equally through an AI-augmented wastewater system.
