## Fish Tracking and Feeding Analysis

This project develops a computer-vision-based framework for automated fish size
estimation and tracking. The system enables non-invasive monitoring of fish
growing patterns.

## Detection and Tracking Example

| Detection Result | Tracking Demo |
|------------------|---------------|

## Ongoing and Future Work

- Data acquisition system  
- Monocular and stereo-based fish length estimation  
- Robust multi-object tracking under occlusion and varying illumination
